In your virtual machine, as the `root` user, navigate to the `/var/www/html` directory and clone the `unitmaster_client_portal_api` repository
<Note>
If the `html` directory is not present, proceed to create one; this will require `root` privilleges
</Note>
```bash
# Switch to the root user
sudo -i

# Switch to the /var/www directory
cd /var/www/html
```
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <UNITMASTER-CLIENT-PORTAL-API-REPO-URL-HERE>
```
Switch to the `ft-merg-cic-mobile` branch
```bash
git checkout -b ft-merge-cic-mobile
```

### 2. Configure environment variables
Fill in the variables in the file according to your configurations.
<Note>
With the `.env` file you'll be provided, you'll only need to alter the database credentials for Client Portal API. This depiction below has been entirely redacted for security purposes
</Note>
``` ENV Expandable .env_example
APP_URL=************
NODE_ENV=************

EMAIL_USER=************
EMAIL_PASSWORD=************
EMAIL_HOST=************
MAIL_FROM_NAME=************

API_URL=************
CALLBACK=************

```

### 3. Edit the docker-compose.yaml file
Edit the present 'docker-compose.yaml' file to include the 'network' parameter
```YAML docker-compose.yaml highlight={4}
....
build:
    context: .
    network: host # --> Newly added
ports:
....
```

### 4. Start the API service
Start the API service using Docker Compose in a detached mode
```bash
cd unitmaster_client_portal_api
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify that the service is running as expected
```bash
docker ps -a
```

You should see an output similar to the one below
![Docker API Service running](../images/docker-api-service-running.png)

### 5. Update UFW rules
We'll have to update the UFW rules to allow the API container to connect to the database
- Get the Docker Container IP Address
```bash
  # List the available Docker networks
  docker network ls

  # You should see a number of networks, among them one with the name unitmaster_client_portal_api...
  # Inspect it using the following command
  docker network inspect unitmaster_client_portal_api
```
  You will get an output from the command containing the network details. Scroll to the bottom at the `Containers` section, find our container by its name
  and note down its `IPv4Address`
  ![Container IP Address](../images/docker-network-inspect-ip.png)

- Update UFW rules to allow Container IP to connect to the database
```bash
ufw allow from <API-Container-IP-Address> to any port <Port-Number> proto <Protocol>

# For example
# ufw allow from 192.168.1.1 to any port 1234 proto tcp
```

- Verify the UFW changes
```bash
ufw status
```
You should see the new rule that was just added

### 5. Change ownership to the project
Grant the necessary permissions on the project folder. 
Change the ownership of the project folder to point to the `www-data` user (Nginx)
  ```bash
  chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/unitmaster-client-portal-api-repo

  # For example
  # chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/unitmaster_client_portal_api
  ```

### 6. Test the API Service
```bash
  curl localhost:<PORT_NUMBER>/api/health_check

  # For example
  # curl localhost:5000/api/health_check
  ```
  <Check>
  You should see the following output printed out in the terminal:
  `{"success":true,"message":"API is running"}`
  </Check>
