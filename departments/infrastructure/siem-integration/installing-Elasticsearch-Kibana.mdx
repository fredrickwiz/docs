### 1. Install Elasticsearch
Depending on your setup, proceed to the Elastic's [Official site](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/) to install Elasticsearch.
- For example, if you want to deploy a self-managed version of Elasticsearch in Ubuntu, you can install it with a debian package.
    - [Install Elasticsearch with a Debian package](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-elasticsearch-with-debian-package)

Once Elasticsearch is done installing, you will notice the output in your terminal looking something like this:
```bash
.....
Authentication and authorization are enabled.
TLS for the transport and HTTP layers is enabled and configured.

The generated password for the elastic built-in superuser is : ABCD1234568lrif

If this node should join an existing cluster, you can reconfigure this with
'/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reconfigure-node --enrollment-token <token-here>'
after creating an enrollment token on your existing cluster.

You can complete the following actions at any time:

Reset the password of the elastic built-in superuser with 
'/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic'.

Generate an enrollment token for Kibana instances with 
 '/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana'.

Generate an enrollment token for Elasticsearch nodes with 
'/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node'.
```
<Note>
Take note of the `elastic` built-in superuser password generated, you will use this later. You will also notice other commands listed in the output that can be of use down the line
