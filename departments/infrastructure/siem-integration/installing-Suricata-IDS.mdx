## Getting started with Suricata
Suricata is a powerful open-source Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) that can
help you secure your system.

### 1. Update packages index
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### 2. Install Suricata
```bash
sudo apt install suricata
```

### 3. Configure Suricata
After the installation is finished, we must configure Suricata to meet our needs. Suricata's main configuration file is found at `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml`:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
```

### 4. Enable Network Interfaces
uricata by default doesn't monitor any network interfaces and needs to know which interfaces to analyze. Look in the configuration file for the af-packet section. 
Uncomment the interface line and enter the name of the network interface Suricata should monitor. For example:
```bash
af-packet:
  - interface: eth0
```

Suricata will monitor the network interface `eth0` in this example. Save your changes and close the text editor.

### 5. Start Suricata on Ubuntu
```bash
sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i interface
```

Replace `interface` with the name of the interface you created in the previous step. This command starts Suricat with the specified configuration file and network interface.


### Troubleshooting Suricata
If you will encounter the following warning message:
```bash
22/6/2023 — 10:04:31 - This is Suricata version 6.0.4 RELEASE running in SYSTEM mode
22/6/2023 — 10:04:31 - [ERRCODE: SC_ERR_NO_RULES(42)] - No rule files match the pattern /etc/suricata/rules/suricata.rules
22/6/2023 — 10:04:31 - [ERRCODE: SC_ERR_NO_RULES_LOADED(43)] - 1 rule files specified, but no rules were loaded!
22/6/2023 — 10:04:31 - all 4 packet processing threads, 4 management threads initialized, engine started
```
Follow these steps:
- Step 1: Run the following command to update Suricata:
  ```bash
  suricata-update
  ```

- Step 2. Open `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` and configure default-rule path option like below:
  ```yaml suricata.yaml
  default-rule-path: /var/lib/suricata/rules
  rule-files:
    suricata.rules
  ```

### 6. Suricata startup automation
We will create a systemd service unit to have Suricata start automatically when your Ubuntu system boots up. To make a new service file, use the following command:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/suricata.service
```

In the service file, add the following lines
```conf suricata.service
[Unit]
Description=Suricata IDS/IPS
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Make sure to change `eth0` with your network interface. Exit the text editor and save the file.
Then, to enable and start the Suricata service, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable suricata.service
sudo systemctl start suricata.service
```

Suricata will be configured to start automatically every time your system boots using these commands.
