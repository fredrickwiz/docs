We'll use Let's Encrypt to obtain our SSL certificates
### 1. Install Certbot
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

### 2. Allow SSH connections through the firewall
Verify our firewall status
```bash
sudo ufw status
```
The output will look something like this, meaning that only HTTPS traffic is allowed to the web server:

| To               | Action | From          |
| -----------------|--------|-------------- |
| Nginx HTTPS      | Allow  | Anywhere      |
| 5433             | Allow  | Anywhere      |
| 5433 (v6)        | Allow  | Anywhere (v6) |
| Nginx HTTPS (v6) | Allow  | Anywhere (v6) |

Allow the Nginx Full profile and delete the redundant Nginx HTTPS profile allowance

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw delete allow 'Nginx HTTPS'
```
Your ufw status should look like this now:

| To               | Action | From          |
| -----------------|--------|-------------- |
| Nginx Full       | Allow  | Anywhere      |
| 5433             | Allow  | Anywhere      |
| 5433 (v6)        | Allow  | Anywhere (v6) |
| Nginx Full (v6)  | Allow  | Anywhere (v6) |

### 3. Obtain the SSL Certificates
The Nginx plugin will take care of reconfiguring Nginx and reloading the config whenever necessary.
```bash
certbot --nginx -d <your-unitmaster-domain-here>

# For example
# certbot --nginx -d unitmaster.wizglobal.co.ke
```

You will be prompted a series of questions like email address, city etc. Fill them in until your certificate is generated.
Repeat the command above for the `client portal` and `API` domains as well

After the SSL certificates have been generated. You can verify this by navigating to the projects' respective Nginx configurations.
For example, for the unitmaster nginx configuration, it will now look something like this

```conf unitmasterv2
server {

    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name unitmaster.wizglobal.co.ke;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/unitmaster.wizglobal.co.ke/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/unitmaster.wizglobal.co.ke/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot

    # ..... the rest of the file continues .....
```
Certbot will store the SSL certificates in the `/etc/letsencrypt/live/` directory

You can verify the other Nginx configuration files as well

### 4. Visit your domains
Test out your results by visiting your domains by using the `https` protocol in the browser i.e `https://unitmaster.wizglobal.co.ke`. 
You will notice that your site(s) now load with the generated SSL certificates
