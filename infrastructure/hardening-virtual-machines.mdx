description: "Hardening virtual machines involves securing them against potential threats by reducing the 
attack surface and implementing security best practices. This includes updating the system, managing users, 
securing the network and file system, and configuring SSH and other services securely."

## Setting up
1. Navigate to the [Ubuntu Pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro) webpage and subscribe for Ubuntu Pro
2. Depending on your setup needs, you can get the subscription as an organization or for yourself. Signing up for
 a personal subscription will get you **5 machines** for you or any business you own, or **50 machines for active 
[Ubuntu Community members](https://ubuntu.com/community/membership).**
3. Once you've gotten a subscription and verified your Ubuntu Pro account, navigate to the 
[dashboard](https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard) page to view the token that you will use to activate your virtual machine.

4. Copy the command to attach to your virtual machine
```bash
sudo pro attach UBUNTU-PRO-TOKEN-HERE
```
5. After that command has executed successfully, you can check for available updates with the following command
```bash
sudo pro security-status
```
