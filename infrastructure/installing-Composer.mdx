## Install Composer
### Step 1: Composer requires PHP and certain extensions.
```bash
sudo apt install php-cli php-zip unzip curl
```

### Step 2: Download the composer installer
```bash
cd ~ && curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer -o /tmp/composer-setup.php
```
<Note>
You'll need to retry the above command as `root` in case you `ls` the `/tmp` directory and you fail to find the `composer-setup.php` file
</Note>

### Step 3: Fetch the latest installer signature and compare it with the downloaded file's hash to ensure the installer is not corrupted:
```bash
HASH=`curl -sS https://composer.github.io/installer.sig`
php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', '/tmp/composer-setup.php') === '$HASH') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
```

### Step 4: Install Composer as a system-wide command, making it accessible from any directory:
```bash
sudo php /tmp/composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

### Step 5: Verify the installation
```bash
composer --version
```
