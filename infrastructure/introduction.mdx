## Setting up
Get your virtual machine up and running in minutes

### Step 1: Create a new (non-root) user
Once you've logged into your VM. You need to create another user other than the already existing 
root. In the terminal, use the following commands to do so:

```bash
sudo adduser [username]
```

You will be prompted to set a password for the new user and provide optional information such as 
full name and contact details
Once the information is entered and confirmed, the new user account will be created with its own home directory.


### Step 2: Block the `root` user from being able to log in using SSH
This is for security purposes in our production environment
1. Open the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` using nano or vim
2. Find the section in the file containing the line `#PermitRootLogin yes` in it.
3. Uncomment and change it to `PermitRootLogin no`
4. Save the file and exit
5. Restart the sshd service:
```bash
# Restarting the sshd service
/etc/init.d/sshd restart
systemctl restart sshd
service sshd restart
```
From now on, any attempt to SSH into the server using the `root` user's credentials will automatically be denied.


### Step 3: Update & Upgrade the system
Update and upgrade the system packages
```bash
# Update the system packages
sudo apt update

# Upgrade the system packages
sudo apt upgrade
```
