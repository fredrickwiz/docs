title: "Setting up UFW ports"
description: "Setting up Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) ports involves defining rules to 
allow or deny network traffic on specific ports or services."
---

Check UFW status. Verify if UFW is active
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

Enable UFW: If inactive, enable the Firewall
```bash
sudo ufw enable
```
<Warning>
Enabling UFW before allowing essential 
services like SSH can lock you out of your server.
</Warning>
1. Change the default SSH port to be 7885
Open sshd_config using nano or the text editor of your choice 

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

2. Locate the line that specifies the port, which is typically port 22. Uncomment
this line by removing the `#` symbol if it's present; and then change `22` to your desired
port numver `7885`
```text
port 2222
```

3. Save the changes to the file and exit the text editor i.e `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm saving, and `Enter` to write the file.

4. Proceed to allow the newly set port (replace `7885` with your port number of choice)
```bash
sudo ufw allow 7885
```

5. You may also want to delete the rule allowing the old port (if it exists)
```bash
sudo ufw delete allow 22
```

6. For the changes to take effect, restart the SSH service
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
So the next time you will be loggin in to the system via SSH, you will use port `7885` instead of `22`.

7. Proceed to add the following rules to your UFW table
```bash
# This is for our Postgresql database that we'll set up later
sudo ufw allow 5433

# This is for allowing only SSL connections to access our system
sudo ufw allow 443

# This is for our API service that we'll set up later
sudo ufw allow 5000

# This is for enabling Nginx in HTTPS mod
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTPS'

# We'll enable Port 80 for now, but we'll remove it later
sudo ufw allow 80
```
