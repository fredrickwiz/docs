In your server terminal, proceed to update the system packages and install Stunnel

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install stunnel4 -y
```

Proceed to enable `stunnel4` to start automatically by opening the `/etc/default/stunnel4` file with a text editor,
such as `nano`
Change/add the line `ENABLED=1`

Create the `stunnel` configuration file at `/etc/stunnel/google-ldap.conf` and add the following:
```conf
debug = 7
output = /var/log/stunnel4/stunnel_wiz.log

[ldap]
client = yes
accept = 127.0.0.1:1636
connect = ldap.google.com:636
cert = /var/google-ldap.crt
key = /var/google-ldap.key
CAfile = /var/google-ldap-ca.pem
verifyChain = yes
checkHost = ldap.google.com
OCSPaia = yes
```
Save and close the file.

Proceed to add the Google provided certificates to the desired locations as stated in the stunnel conf file and provide them with the necessary permissions.
Enable stunnel by running `systemctl enable stunnel4`
